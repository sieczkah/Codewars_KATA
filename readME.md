### Every_Day_Codewars
#### This repo will be my everyday Codewars blog to track my challenge. I will complete and post at least 5 Kata with links and my code everyday. 

CodeWars is a platform with programming challenges. 
**Kata** is a problem that you have to solve using programming language. Each Kata has its **kyu** (rank), the lower the kyu is the harder is the kata.

05.02 Update: I had a day brake from the challenge to write a program that will create kata named .py with code and link to kata, because creating it manually was annoying. The simple program is [here](https://github.com/sieczkah/CodeWars_Adder) I will want to improve it soon cos now its fast written script.
